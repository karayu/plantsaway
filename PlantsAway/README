Plants Away is a piece of commentary on modern society. 

It features an old lady that sits on a rooftop waiting for people to come by.  
She dislikes skateboarders immensely and tries to rid the world of them by dropping plants on them. 
She likes women with babies and regrets dropping the plants on them

For the Alpha, we kept the game to simple game play with different scenes for the game ending and game pause. 
In the release, we will have more levels, more plants and boosts (like the old lady walking faster)
