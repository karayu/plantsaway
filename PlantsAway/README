Plants Away is a piece of commentary on modern society. 

It features an old lady that sits on a rooftop waiting for people to come by.  
She dislikes skateboarders immensely and tries to rid the world of them by dropping plants on them. 
She likes women with babies and regrets dropping the plants on them.

For the Release, we have added infinite levels (in which old Lady gets slower with each level, making it more difficult to maintain high scores), a high scores table, multiple plants to choose from, and fun boosts for our oldLady.

A few NEW things to note:
    * High Scores is working, but not with the originally intended web services.  After many hours of reading about NSURLConnections and hacking away at our code, we decided it wasn't worth the amount of time we were putting into it when we could be working on other aspects of the game.  The current high scores table is a local table of the individual user's highest scores.
    * Boosts control the speed of the oldLady, which is more for fun than anything (it does not affect scorekeeping)
    * Different plants each have a different point value associated with them.  The smaller the plant, the more points it is worth (i.e. for hitting targets with greater accuracy).
    * The levels (with checkpoints at every 50pts added to the score) allow for longer gameplay and higher scores.  Each time the user reaches a level checkpoint, her time is reset to 100 and oldLady becomes a little bit slower.  Eventually, oldLady will become so slow that the user can barely still keep scoring... or even moving.  It's quite funny.  This was originally one of our "reach" goals WOOOO!
