Plants Away is a piece of commentary on modern society. 

It features an old lady that sits on a rooftop waiting for people to come by.  
She dislikes skateboarders immensely and tries to rid the world of them by dropping plants on them. 
She likes women with babies and regrets dropping the plants on them.

For the Alpha, we kept the game to simple game play with different scenes for the game ending and game pause. 
In the release, we will have more levels, a web-services high scores table, more plants and boosts (like the old lady walking faster) 

A few things to note:
    * We implemented this game using the Cocos2D framework: http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/
    * High Scores does not currently work.  We have set up the basics for establishing NSURLConnections but have not actually connected to our own server yet to store and retrieve the high scores.  We will be using the user's device ID as their unique identifier.
    * When the user goes to the Pause menu, the "Resume Game" link does not actually resume their game.  It establishes a new game with their given amount of time left (from whenever they paused the game) and sets the score to whatever their score was when clicking Pause.  We can hopefully adjust this so it genuinely freezes game play and returns to it when the user pauses for the release.
    * Cocos2D works with Layers that act like Photoshop layers (note how our program is broken down into various layers like GamePausedLayer, HighScoresLayer, etc) that act as BOTH controllers and view files.  While still generally using the MVC architeture, Cocos2D uses no xib file so the visual aspect of gameplay is implemented in these layers, which also define the functionality for the objects in each layer (as a controller).
    * SORRY ABOUT ALL THE MODEL FILES -- we have not yet decided exactly how we want to divide up functions into classes so for now we have quite a bit of file clutter because of that.
